      <p>Last updated: August 13, 2025</p>

      <p>
        At <strong>4-7-8</strong>, your privacy is important to us. This
        app is designed to function entirely on your device â€” we do not collect,
        store, or share any personal information.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Collection</h2>
      <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> collect, track, or store any user data.
        Everything you do in the app, including session history and settings,
        is stored locally on your device only.
      </p>

      <h2>Account & Sign-In</h2>
      <p>
        No account is required to use the app. You will never be asked to sign
        in or provide personal details.
      </p>

      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        The app does not use analytics tools, advertising networks, or any
        third-party services that collect data.
      </p>

      <h2>Your Control</h2>
      <p>
        You are in full control of your data since it never leaves your device.
        If you uninstall the app, all locally stored data is permanently
        deleted.
      </p>

      <h2>Contact</h2>
